# Large Scale Spatiotemporal Data Analytics and Learning

This repository is for the UROP project in the Fall semester, 2022, supervised by Prof. [ZHOU Xiaofang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/zxf).

## Project description
This project presents an interactive data visualization system tailor-made for spatiotemporal data.

## Prerequisites
Since this project is developed using the Django framework, it is a prerequisite to have it installed. To install django, run `pip install django`. It is also suggested to create a virtual environment for your django projects as mentioned in [this django tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5mRW0jo-U4&t=2791s). To initiate a new virtual environment, run `virtualenv -p python3` in your working directory.

## How to run
1. `cd` to the working directory where the virtual environment was created. Run `source bin/activate` to activate your virtual environment.
2. `cd` to the project directory where there is a `manage.py` file at the root. Run `python manage.py runserver` to start your server.
3. Click the link displayed in the terminal, and add `/home/` at the end of the link to jump to the project home page.
4. Start exploring the project. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:    

If you are still unclear about getting started with Django, check [this django tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5mRW0jo-U4&t=2791s) out.
